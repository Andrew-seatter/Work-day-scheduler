# Work-day-scheduler

## Description

This is a work day scheduler to keep track of your time throughout the day. I used jquery for handling the time inputs through out the day.
As the day goes on all boxes that the time has passed will grey out, if the the time is current with the box it will change to red, and if the time has yet to come for that task the box will remain green. Using the save button will save your tasks to the respective boxes and display them upon revisiting the page. Learned a lot about Jquery on this project.

## Installation

## Usage

Built largely on Jquery with some vanilla JS in the mix. Upon saving the text boxes the page is saved to local storage to be able to displayed
on next load of the page.
